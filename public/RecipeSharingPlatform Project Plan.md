Great! It's excellent to hear that you're interested in project-based learning and want to develop a full stack application. Focusing on projects is a fantastic way to learn as it allows you to apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios.

Given your background in Python, HTML, and CSS, I'll suggest a full stack project that incorporates these technologies while introducing you to new ones. Let's build a "Recipe Sharing Platform." This platform will allow users to create, view, and share their favorite recipes. It will involve frontend development (HTML/CSS), backend development (Python), and a database to store recipe information.

**Project: Recipe Sharing Platform**

**Learning Objectives:**

1. Frontend Development: Enhance your HTML and CSS skills to create a user-friendly recipe-sharing website layout.
2. Backend Development: Learn a new programming language for the backend. I recommend using Node.js with Express, which is a popular choice for full stack applications.
3. Database Management: Integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) to store recipe information, such as recipe names, ingredients, and preparation steps.
4. User Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionalities to allow users to create and manage their recipes.

**Project Tasks:**

1. Frontend:

   - Design a homepage with a navigation bar, a section to display featured recipes, and a call-to-action button for adding a new recipe.
   - Create a recipe detail page to display the full recipe, including ingredients and preparation steps.
   - Design a user registration and login page.

2. Backend:

   - Set up a Node.js project with Express to handle HTTP requests and responses.
   - Implement API endpoints for retrieving recipe information and creating new recipes.
   - Create routes for user registration and login.

3. Database:

   - Choose and set up a database (MongoDB) to store recipe information.
   - Design the database schema to represent recipes and users.

4. User Authentication:
   - Implement user registration using email and password.
   - Enable user login and session management to maintain user sessions.

**Additional Ideas:**

- Add a search functionality to allow users to find recipes by name, ingredients, or tags.
- Implement a rating and review system for users to rate and comment on recipes.
- Make the platform responsive so that it works well on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Remember, learning full stack development is an ongoing process, and each project you build will help you improve your skills. If you're ready to start, go ahead and begin with the frontend part, and let me know if you need any further assistance or have any questions along the way. Happy coding!

Pat's suggestion: Differentiating feature: the ability to make notes on recipes - changes that were made etc. Save these notes to your account to specific recipe.
